Running Jupyter and Theia in a Separate Application Window
==========================================================

If you find yourself frequently loosing your Jupyter or Theia windows amongst your browser tabs, or if want to alt-tab between your web-based IDE and other applications, then try using [WebApp](https://github.com/container-job-runner/web-app).
WebApp is a minimal electron app we made to open a separate application window for viewing Jupiter Lab/Notebook or Theia.

You can download the latest WebApp binary from the [official releases](https://github.com/container-job-runner/web-app/releases), then untar the file and store it in a permenant location.
To link WebApp with cjr, run the following command:
```console
$ cjr config:set --on-server-start="open -n $PATH_TO_WEBAPP"              (MAC)
$ cjr config:set --on-server-start="./$PATH_TO_WEBAPP"                    (LINUX)
```
When you now run commands like `cjr jupyter:start --here --stack=fedora-sc`, jupyter will open in a WebApp Window.

**Important**: WebApp is not a signed app. On mac you will first need to authorize the app by right clicking on the downloaded file, selecting open, and then clicking open in the system dialog.

If you no longer want to use WebApp you can simply delete the app and change the default on-start command back to its default value
```console
$ cjr config:set --on-server-start="open $URL"                            (MAC)
$ cjr config:set --on-server-start="xdg-open $URL"                        (LINUX)
```
