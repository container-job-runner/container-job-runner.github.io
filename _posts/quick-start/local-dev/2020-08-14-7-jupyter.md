Jupyter
==========================

We know that computational scientists love using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). Thatâ€™s why cjr has commands to start and stop Jupyter notebooks or Jupyter lab. Jupyter comes preinstalled in the *fedora-sc* stack, so we can start it using the command

```console
$ cjr jupyter:start --here --stack=fedora-sc
```

After a few seconds, Jupyter lab will open in your default browser. The jupyter command works just like the shell command. We added the flag `--here` so that we can view and modify the files in the current directory from Jupyter.

We can view all running jupyter servers that were started with cjr by running the command

```console
$ cjr jupyter:ls
```

To stop jupyter you can run the stop command from the same directory where you originally started jupyter:

```console
$ cjr jupyter:stop --here 
```

Alternatively you can run `cjr jupyter:stop DIR` where DIR is the directory where you started jupyter. If you are running jupyter servers in multiple  directories, you can stop them all at once using `cjr jupyter:stop --all`.


## Switching between Jupyter Lab and Jupyter notebook 

By default cjr runs Jupyter lab. You can change the default to Jupyter notebooks using the command
```console
$ cjr config:set --jupyter-command="jupyter notebook"
```
and you can switch back to Jupyter lab with the command
```console
$ cjr config:set --jupyter-command="jupyter lab"
```
