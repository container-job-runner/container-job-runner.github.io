Overview
=======================

This quick start guide teaches you how to configure a remote resource and use cjr to run jobs on it. 
The great news is that cjr treats remotes job in exactly the same way as local jobs, so you won't need to learn any new job commands. 

When you run remote jobs you never need to manually access the remote machine. Instead remote jobs are all started using cjr from your local machine.
This allows you to develop and test your code locally and then use cjr to seamlessly launch a computationally intensive job on a more powerful cloud computer or remote server.
The key differences when you start a remote job are:
1. Your project files are now copied to the remote computer, rather than being copied to a separate volume on your local machine.
2. The computation takes place on the remote computer, not your local computer.

## Requirements

Cjr currently supports remote resources that can be accessed through ssh. To follow along with this tutorial you will the following need:

1. The IP address and username used to access the remote computer over ssh.
2. The private key file used for ssh; cjr requires that passwordless ssh is set up.
3. [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) must be installed on the remote resource.
